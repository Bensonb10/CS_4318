The report for this phase includes:

* Project title, team name (if there is one), full official names of all team members (5 pts)

* Abstract: a short (approximately one paragraph) description of the database application you propose to work with throughout the course. Your description should be clear and concise. It should also include any constraints that need to be imposed based on the application being modeled. (10 pts)

* Mission statement. (10 pts)

* Mission objectives. (15 pts)

* Major user views. (15 pts)

* An E/R diagram for your proposed database. Specify key attributes for entity sets, specify relationships with arrowheads. For a team of 2 students, the E/R diagram must have at least 7 entities. For a team of 3 students, the E/R diagram must have at least 9 entities. When defining entities, you should avoid two common mistakes: splitting one entity into multiples ones, or mixing multiple entities into one.  (15 pts)

* A list of uses cases that include actor and step-by-step descriptions. For every entity, you must have one use case that perform one insert operation, one delete operation, and one update operation.  You must also have one use case for every relationship. __That’s a minimum of 27 use cases for 7 entities, and 35 use cases for 9 entities__ (30 pts)
