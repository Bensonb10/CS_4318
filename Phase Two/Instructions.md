# [Phase 2 Instruction](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/yuans/courses/cs4318/projects/phase2.htm)

In this second phase, you will produce a relational schema from the entity-relationship diagram you came up with in Phase 1, and verify all use cases are being realized. Make sure to address issues (remarks) raised by your instructor in the first phase, if any.

 

Submit the following:

**Complete E/R diagram from Phase 1 (20 points)**
On you E/R diagram, clearly describe each entity (including, list of entity attributes, and the primary key), and each relationship with its multiplicities.

 

**Relational Model  (20 points)**
Using the method for translating an E/R diagram to relations, produce a set of tables for your database design. For each table, specify the attributes, their domains, required data constraints, default values, primary key, candidate keys, foreign keys and the tables which the foreign keys are referencing (everything you need for a CREATE TABLE statement)

 

**Complete Database Functionalities and User Interface  (40 points)**
* List all actors (i.e. users) of your database
* For each actor, list all use-cases including all the steps. For each entity, you must have use cases that perform at least one aggregate query, one insert operation, one delete operation, and one update operation; For each relationship, you must have use cases that perform at least one joint query. (That’s a minimum of 34 use cases for 7 entities, and 44 use cases for 9 entities)
* Use Case Realization: Explain how the relations and relationships are used in EACH of the use cases. Provide the complete SQL statements for every use case.
* Specify the web interface if you are implementing it. 

**Database Prototype  (10 points)**
* Describe platform and any software tools you plan to use to implement your project.
* Clearly indicate how you plan to populate your database.

**Project Time Table  (10 points)**
* List major tasks to a be completed
* For each task, indicate team member responsible for competing task, and planned completion dates.
